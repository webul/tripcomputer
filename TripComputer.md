## Introduction ##
TripComputer is a personal off-road GPS navigation utility software for Google Android phone, that has been created for active people, who love travel by hike or bike.


### Details ###
Application does not use Internet connection or Google Maps for navigation or track recording, but you can share your data to others, or store your data on server.

All you have is your own map view with bearing, distance to targets, your recorded tracks, orientation waypoints and compass with directions.

With such a lot of information about your position, you can go everywhere you want, and safely return home, no matter where you are: forests, meadows, fields, mountains or lakes.


### Main features: ###
  * locating your position with GPS
  * recording tracks of your travel
  * storing orientation waypoints
  * navigating with compass, direction to track or waypoint, distance, estimated time
  * easy to use interface
  * waypoints sharing and searching


### Version information ###
First, 1.0 official version of application has been introduced in 1 September of 2009.

After four months, version 1.5 with many improvements has been released in January 2010.


### Web Service Access ###
Application can exchange data with GAE web service:

[TripComputer Mapa](http://tripcomputerwebservice.appspot.com) (for now in Polish).

It just connects with http client to web service. At this time (version 1.5), user can send, search for and download waypoints directly to a device.

Also, user can go to GAE link given above and login to web service via browser. Web application shows waypoints sent by user on a Google Map view and these waypoints can be fully edited.

There are some improvements waiting to be done: for example:
  * adding new waypoints directly in browser
  * creating routes of waypoints for a trip
  * multilanguage (ENglish/POlish switchable) support
